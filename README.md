Prepare the data in 2 different ways. 
1. Alzheimer Detection: Whether the patient has the alzhiemer or not (non vs all other categories) 
2. Alzheimer Classifier: Define what stage the patient is in the alzheimer. 

The models that are going to be tested here are 
1. PCA for Alzheimer Detection
2. LDA for Alzheimer Detection
3. SVM for Alzheimer Detection and Alzheimer Classifier
4. CNN for Alzheimer Detection(VGG16) and Alzheimer Classifier(EfficientNetB0)
